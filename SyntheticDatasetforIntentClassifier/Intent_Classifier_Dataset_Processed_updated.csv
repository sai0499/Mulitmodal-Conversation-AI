here he comes now.,general question
we've been sitting here for almost 10 minutes.,general question
"oops, i guess i was wrong. that isn't our waiter.",general question
"we can give him five more minutes, and then leave.",general question
i'll go up front and talk to the manager.,general question

but the best deal was five pounds of potatoes for 99 cents.,general question
i don't know how that store makes money.,general question
i need a new computer.,general question
what's the matter with yours?,general question
it's six years old.,general question
that's pretty old.,general question
"it still works, but i'm going to give it to a charity.",general question
are you going to buy a desktop or laptop?,general question
"oh, a laptop, of course.",general question
a pc or a mac?,general question
i haven't decided yet.,general question
more and more people are using macs.,general question
but 90 percent of the world uses pcs.,general question
i got ripped off.,general question
what happened?,general question
"i had a car problem, so i went online.",general question
did you find a solution?,general question
"yes, i did. a site i went to said they would send me the solution.",general question
"so, what's the problem?",general question
"i sent them $20 using my credit card, but they never sent me the solution.",general question
what are you going to do?,general question
i sent them an email asking for my money back.,general question
have you heard from them?,general question
not yet. it's been a week.,general question
where's the pencil sharpener?,general question
which one?,general question
any one. i need to sharpen this pencil.,general question
i think there's one on the dining room table.,general question
i already looked there.,general question
did you look in the desk drawer?,general question
"yes, i looked there, too.",general question
don't we have about five sharpeners?,general question
"yes, but they seem to have legs.",general question
tomorrow i'm going to buy an electric sharpener.,general question
get one with the rubber suction cups on the bottom.,general question
i'm trying to stretch my dollars.,general question
how are you doing that?,general question
i started shopping at the dollar store.,general question
that saves a lot of money.,general question
i bought three pounds of potatoes for a dollar.,general question
that's a good deal.,general question
"yes, even though some of the potatoes had eyes.",general question
just put them in the fridge.,general question
"also, i bought a can of cheap coffee and a bag of good coffee.",general question
why did you do that?,general question
i mixed them together.,general question
i really like this house.,general question
can we afford it?,general question
they want 20 percent down.,general question
that's a lot of money.,general question
but the house is so nice.,general question
it's in a great neighborhood.,general question
it's close to the beach.,general question
it's close to the freeways.,general question
it's got a big yard.,general question
"the kids love the house, too.",general question
"if we don't buy it, someone else will.",general question
we can't afford this house.,general question
are you sure?,general question
"we will be house rich, but cash poor.",general question
what do you mean?,general question
our monthly payments will be too high.,general question
we won't have any money for other things?,general question
"no, we won't have money for gas or food.",general question
we'll be eating peanut butter sandwiches?,general question
without the peanut butter!,general question
that's no good!,general question
we have to find a cheaper house.,general question
that is a beautiful house.,general question
i don't like it.,general question
what's the matter with it?,general question
it's on the corner.,general question
so?,general question
that means it gets twice as much traffic.,general question
you're right.,general question
"when you're inside, you will always hear cars stopping and stopping at the intersection.",general question
or you'll hear the collision if someone doesn't stop.,general question
or you'll see the collision if they crash into the house.,general question
let's find a house that's at the end of a dead end.,general question
i hate looking for an apartment.,general question
"me, too.",general question
we have a 2 o'clock appointment to see the one on main street.,general question
we'd better get ready to go.,general question
it's an upstairs unit.,general question
"that's good, because i don't want to live under people with loud feet.",general question
and it's a corner unit.,general question
that's great. we won't have neighbors on both sides of us.,general question
no pets are allowed.,general question
perfect. we don't have to listen to barking dogs.,general question
and there are only six units in the whole building.,general question
did you call the manager?,general question
yes. he said he'd come over tomorrow.,general question
did he say what time?,general question
yes. he said he'd be here at 9 o'clock.,general question
did he understand what the problem is?,general question
yes. i told him our doorbell doesn't work.,general question
it shouldn't take him long to fix it.,general question
i don't even know why we need to fix it.,general question
in case we have visitors.,general question
but they can just knock on the door.,general question
"actually, i want him to look at our carpet, too.",general question
do you like this house?,general question
"yes, it's beautiful.",general question
it's perfect for us and the kids.,general question
"three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a big back yard.",general question
and we can afford it!,general question
so are we going to buy it?,general question
i'm afraid not.,general question
"it's too far from your job, isn't it?",general question
i can't spend four hours on the road every day.,general question
"by the time you get home, you'll be too tired to even eat.",general question
i won't be able to play with the kids.,general question
"boy, it's chilly outside, isn't it?",general question
it sure is.,general question
"in fact, it's chilly in the apartment, too.",general question
let's turn on the heat.,general question
i'll check to make sure that all the windows are shut.,general question
it should be warmer in a few minutes.,general question
it's so nice to have a heated apartment.,general question
how did they survive in the old days?,general question
they had fireplaces.,general question
someone had to chop the wood.,general question
and carry it into the house.,general question
this is a nice neighborhood.,general question
the streets are clean and quiet.,general question
the neighbors don't party on the weekends.,general question
people take care of their lawns.,general question
no rusty old cars are sitting in the front yards.,general question
we never have to call the police about anything.,general question
our kids are completely safe.,general question
so why are we selling our house?,general question
they're building a 3-story apartment building on the corner.,general question
so we've got to sell before property values go down?,general question
yes. i still can't believe our city council allowed this building.,general question
that was a huge fire in santa barbara.,general question
"yes, it was.",general question
they said about 30 houses burned to the ground.,general question
and they were expensive houses.,general question
i feel so sorry for those people.,general question
why feel sorry for rich people?,general question
i feel sorry for anyone who loses their home.,general question
"so do i, but not if they're rich.",general question
what does that have to do with it?,general question
rich people think they're better than us.,general question
how many rich people do you know?,general question
bears are invading our neighborhoods.,general question
of course they are. they're starving to death.,general question
they should stay in the woods where they belong.,general question
there's no food in the woods.,general question
can't they eat grass?,general question
do you think a bear is a cow?,general question
"well, i've seen them eating berries.",general question
berries aren't in season all year round.,general question
it's too dangerous for kids and pets.,general question
people need to cover their trash cans.,general question
the police need to shoot all the bears.,general question
who did you vote for?,general question
i voted for obama.,general question
me too.,general question
he will be a great president.,general question
everyone likes him.,general question
he's a good speaker.,general question
and he's really smart.,general question
he will solve our problems.,general question
he will end the war.,general question
the next four years will be good years.,general question
"i'll vote for him next time, too.",general question
the election is next week.,general question
who are you voting for?,general question
i'm not voting for the mayor.,general question
why not?,general question
he made promises that he didn't keep.,general question
like what?,general question
"he promised to hire 1,000 more police officers.",general question
how many did he hire?,general question
one hundred!,general question
maybe he had a good reason.,general question
maybe he's just a liar.,general question
i can't believe he won the election.,general question
only 15 percent of the voters turned out.,general question
that is a joke.,general question
"voting is so important, but people don't bother.",general question
many people think their vote doesn't matter.,general question
"the mayor won by only 2,000 votes.",general question
we're stuck with him for four more years.,general question
voting is so easy. you can even mail your ballot in.,general question
all you have to do is vote and put a stamp on it.,general question
how easy is that?,general question
i guess people just don't care.,general question
"well, we have a new president.",general question
but we have the same old problems.,general question
"well, he's made a few changes.",general question
like what?,general question
i think he closed the bowling alley in the white house.,general question
"oh, yeah. he's changing it to a basketball court.",general question
who's paying for that?,general question
i think we are!,general question
"well, that's okay, as long as it helps him relax and think more clearly.",general question
"yes, we need a relaxed president who thinks clearly.",general question
do any other world leaders have a basketball court?,general question
people say that everybody loves obama.,general question
"well, more than 50 million people voted for mccain.",general question
that's 50 million people who don't love obama.,general question
obama's got four years to make everyone happy.,general question
he's never going to make everyone happy.,general question
can you imagine being president?,general question
everyone wants you to solve their problems.,general question
i have enough stress from trying to solve my own problems.,general question
you and everybody else.,general question
i would never want to be president.,general question
but think about all the power you'd have.,general question
did you read this article?,general question
what article?,general question
it says the mayor spends only 11 percent of his time on city duties.,general question
only 11 percent?,general question
about 50 percent of the time he's traveling.,general question
where does he travel to?,general question
"oh, all over the world.",general question
but he's supposed to be making our city a better place.,general question
he's visiting other cities to get ideas.,general question
can't he just go online?,general question
the rest of the time he's raising money for his reelection.,general question
who did you vote for for president?,general question
i voted for ralph nader.,general question
who in the world is ralph nader?,general question
he's the best man for president.,general question
why's that?,general question
he hates corporations.,general question
"well, most corporations do think only about money.",general question
he hates democrats and republicans.,general question
"well, they do put their party before their country.",general question
he's the only candidate that i trust.,general question
but he didn't have a chance. nobody voted for him!,general question
i don't know why i bother to vote.,general question
why's that?,general question
what good does it do?,general question
you get to put someone in power that you like.,general question
only if my candidate wins.,general question
"well, he can't win unless you and others vote for him.",general question
"but even if my candidate wins, he'll break his promises.",general question
that's true. they promise anything just so they get elected.,general question
"and when elected, they go their own way.",general question
they forget who put them in power.,general question
they forget where they came from.,general question
that election for u.s. senator stunk.,general question
what do you mean?,general question
there were more votes than voters!,general question
but that's impossible.,general question
officials said that it's possible.,general question
did they explain how it's possible?,general question
no. they said there are some things you can't explain.,general question
so are they going to hold another election?,general question
no. that will cost too much money.,general question
so it's better to save money than to have an honest election?,general question
"well, the democratic party says it was an honest election.",general question
i see that former president bush is at a conference.,general question
yes. he's telling jokes about his eight years as president.,general question
"yes, those eight years were a lot of fun for everyone.",general question
"only 4,000 american soldiers were killed overseas.",general question
"not to mention 40,000 wounded soldiers.",general question
but bush visited some of them in the hospital once.,general question
that's nice that he found the time to make a visit.,general question
he spoke to them and made them feel better.,general question
did he speak to every family that lost a soldier?,general question
"no, he didn't have time to do that.",general question
"well, he's got plenty of time now!",general question
did you get your official sample ballot?,general question
"yes, with the voter instructions.",general question
how are you going to vote?,general question
"same as ever, by mail. all it costs me is a 42-cent stamp.",general question
"i meant, are you going to vote for or against the new taxes?",general question
"against all of them, of course.",general question
"but we need new taxes to pay for highways, schools, and prisons.",general question
we've already voted for new taxes to pay for all that stuff!,general question
that's true. where did that money go?,general question
our legislators spent it on first-class travel all over the world.,general question
they are having a good time with our money.,general question
have you decided how you are going to vote?,general question
"do you mean on measures 1, 2, and 3?",general question
"yes. the ones that will improve our schools, roads, and hospitals.",general question
you mean the measures that will raise our taxes.,general question
but the tv ads say that our taxes will not increase.,general question
do you believe the tv ads?,general question
i like the one where the fireman tells us why we should vote yes.,general question
"don't believe him! whatever the tv ads tell you, the opposite is true.",general question
"but the title of measure 1 is ""better schools at no cost.""",general question
"the title should be ""better schools at huge cost.""",general question
i can't believe that they would lie to us.,general question
i have a stomachache.,general question
is it something you ate?,general question
maybe. i'm not sure.,general question
what did you have for breakfast?,general question
"the usual, cereal with milk and a banana.",general question
maybe the milk was bad.,general question
it didn't smell bad.,general question
maybe the banana was bad.,general question
"no, the banana was delicious.",general question
maybe you just need to go to the bathroom.,general question
"no, that's not the problem.",general question
what's this stain?,general question
i don't know.,general question
it looks like blood.,general question
i think my nose was bleeding.,general question
you should wet your shirt immediately.,general question
why?,general question
because that gets the blood out of the shirt.,general question
what's a little blood?,general question
your white shirt is ruined.,general question
"so, i'll just buy another one.",general question
you can wear this one around the house.,general question
my fingers hurt.,general question
why do they hurt?,general question
i type too much.,general question
you should take a break.,general question
i need to type to make money.,general question
but typing is causing you pain.,general question
maybe i should see a doctor.,general question
doctors are too expensive.,general question
he might tell me to rest for a while.,general question
he might want to cut you open.,general question
he might say i'm okay.,general question
what did the doctor say?,general question
he thinks i have too much stress.,general question
stress causes your stomachaches?,general question
stress causes different problems with different people.,general question
so what did he tell you to do?,general question
he said i need to think positive.,general question
he didn't give you any medication?,general question
i hate medication. it makes me feel different.,general question
so how do you think positive?,general question
i think about nice things.,general question
like what?,general question
i cut my finger.,general question
how did you do that?,general question
it's a paper cut.,general question
paper can be dangerous.,general question
"it hurts, too.",general question
paper cuts can hurt a lot.,general question
where are the band-aids?,general question
i think they're in the medicine cabinet.,general question
it's on the tip of my finger.,general question
a band-aid might not work.,general question
i must not use this finger until the cut heals.,general question
do you smell that?,general question
"oh, yes.",general question
i can't stand cigarette smoke.,general question
it smells so bad.,general question
one cigarette stinks up the whole sidewalk.,general question
smokers think they are so cool.,general question
they are so weak.,general question
a little cigarette controls them.,general question
they look so stupid taking a puff.,general question
and then they blow smoke out of their mouth.,general question
they think it's cool.,general question
do you have a cold?,general question
"yes, i do.",general question
how did you get it?,general question
my sister had a cold. she gave it to me.,general question
have you taken anything for your cold?,general question
"no, i just blow my nose a lot.",general question
your nose is stopped up?,general question
yes. i have to breathe through my mouth.,general question
have you tried nose drops?,general question
"no, i don't like nose drops.",general question
they work great.,general question

sure.,general question
thank you.,general question
you shouldn't lie in the sun for too long.,general question
i want to get a tan. i don't want to look so pale.,general question
what's wrong with looking pale?,general question
people think you might be sick.,general question
who thinks that?,general question
i don't know.,general question
it's better to be pale than to have skin cancer.,general question
i know that.,general question
i can't quit smoking.,general question
of course you can.,general question
i don't have enough will power.,general question
of course you do.,general question
i wish i had never started.,general question
so does every smoker.,general question
i've tried to quit so many times.,general question
so has everyone else.,general question
nothing seems to work.,general question
"all it takes is will power, and you have it.",general question
then why can't i quit?,general question
my back is killing me.,general question
what did you do?,general question
i got out of my car.,general question
that's it?,general question
i injured my back one time just by sneezing.,general question
you should see a doctor.,general question
my doctor said i need surgery.,general question
so?,general question
"so, forget it.",general question
you don't have the money?,general question
i have no insurance.,general question
my brother smokes three packs a day.,general question
three packs of what?,general question
"cigarettes, of course.",general question
how can he do that?,general question
"when he is almost finished with one cigarette, he uses it to light another.",general question
he's a chain smoker.,general question
he's been a chain smoker for 30 years.,general question
that's unbelievable. can he still breathe?,general question
"he can, but the people around him can't.",general question
how can he still be alive?,general question
his doctor says his heart and lungs are strong and healthy.,general question
i hate brushing my teeth.,general question
it's such a chore.,general question
"brush, brush. spit, spit.",general question
what did they do in the old days?,general question
they brushed with their fingers.,general question
they also ate with their fingers!,general question
why do they call it the good old days?,general question
maybe because they didn't have to brush and floss.,general question
who invented flossing?,general question
"a dentist, i'm sure.",general question
i hate flossing more than brushing!,general question
let's stop for a while. i need a break and some water.,general question
this trail is hard to climb.,general question
especially on a hot day like this.,general question
i can't believe we haven't seen any animals.,general question

all we've seen so far is a couple of lizards.,general question
"we're hiking to lose weight, not to see goats and bears.",general question
i bet i've lost a couple of pounds already.,general question
all you've lost is some sweat.,general question
i haven't even lost one pound of fat?,general question
"if you want to lose fat, you've got to do this hike every day.",general question
"oh no, another pimple on my face.",general question
pimples suck.,general question
it seems like i get a new pimple almost every day.,general question
maybe it's something in your diet.,general question
"no, i eat the same things day after day.",general question
then maybe it's in your genes.,general question
you might be right.,general question
do pimples run in your family?,general question
not that i've noticed.,general question
"well, maybe it's from the pollution in the air.",general question
"whatever the cause, i hate seeing them on my face.",general question
do you believe everything you hear?,general question
i don't believe anything i don't see with my own eyes.,general question
you can't believe what you hear on tv or radio.,general question
you can't believe what you read in the newspapers.,general question
everyone tells you a different story about the same thing.,general question
three different people will give you three different stories.,general question
and the government will give you a fourth story.,general question
"yes, like the government says not to worry about the swine flu.",general question
but the swine flu just killed 20 people in mexico.,general question

i will rub gently but firmly.,general question
"do it quickly, please, so i can change channels during commercials.",general question
i'll give it back to you in a couple of minutes.,general question
my ear is killing me.,general question
what's the matter?,general question
i was on a plane.,general question
so?,general question
"so, every time the plane goes up, my ear starts to hurt.",general question
that's no good.,general question
"sometimes the pain goes away, and sometimes it doesn't.",general question

i've been to two doctors.,general question
and they couldn't fix your problem?,general question
they both said i have to live with it.,general question

"she got an ""everything"" job!",general question
what do you mean?,general question
a team of doctors gave her a whole new face.,general question

what's wrong with it?,general question
it aches most of the time.,general question
what do you think it is?,general question
i don't know. i think it's old age.,general question
